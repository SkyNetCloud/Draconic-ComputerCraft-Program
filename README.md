# Draconic-ComputerCraft-Program 1.20.1 (Don't know if it works with any other version but this is what I tested it on!)
Computercraft menu for the reactor on Draconic Evolution mod

Setup 3x3 monitor.

Monitor, reactor and the flux gates need to be wired up by the wire modem!

# **BEFORE STARTING THE PROGRAM MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE INPUT FLUX GATE SIGNAL LOW TO 10**

This screenshot is broad view of what it looks like when it all comes together!

The screenshot above shows how the input flux gate is connected to the computer. Its using wired modem to connect to the main computer. The computer automatically changes rf/t input that goes in the reactor to get field strength to 50% longs there power going in it should be able to keep it there. If the computer can't keep the reactor over 15% the computer will shut the reactor down and produce a warning on the screen to tell the user why it was shutdown.

The screenshot above is the monitor. Tells the user all the stats plus some buttons to control the reactor with.

Pastebin Code:
Keep this as startup so if there any updates to the program it automatically updates the files and runs the program

>pastebin get EJPU9YAA startup
